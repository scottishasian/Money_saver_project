## MoneyCashboard

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money. You have decided to make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

### MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display a list of all transactions
- Display total amount spent
- Display total amount spent by tag

### Possible Extensions:

- CRUD actions for the transactions
- Show a warning when the total expenditure is over budget (set a hard coded budget first)
- Add a date to the transactions and view total spending by month
- Any other ideas you might come up with

### User Notes:

- Create a database via 'createdb money_saver' in terminal.
- Attach the money_saver.sql via 'psql -d money_saver -f db/money_saver.sql'
- Run the server via 'ruby app.rb'
- Access the website via 'localhost:4567/'

### Experiences during the project:

Generally I have found this project very enjoyable as it allowed me to push my backend coding abilities and consolidate the knowledge I have gained over the past few weeks. The project was a very relatable concept which helped greatly with the planning.

The most frustrating parts of this endeavour has been the HTML and CSS as these are areas I have been quite unfamiliar with.
